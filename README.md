# Forge tagwall

One page Sinatra app to display the same hashtag from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook in a single display on screen at the event of Forge Copenhagen.
We use it to display tweets, instagrams and public facebook updates tagged with **#forgecph** at [the first Forge event in CPH.](http://www.forgecph.com/)

Super alpha at the time of writing, use at your own peril.

We will update this in the near future, and Pull Requests are always welcome.
